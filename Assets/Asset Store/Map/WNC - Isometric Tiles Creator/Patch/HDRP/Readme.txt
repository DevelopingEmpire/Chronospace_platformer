To install a patch for the Unity3D asset that will change the materials for your render pipeline, follow these steps:

Open your Unity project.
In the "Assets" menu, select "Import Package" and then "Custom Package."
Select the patch unitypackage file you want to install.
In the import window, select the materials you want to replace, and then click "Import."
The materials will be replaced in your project and the asset should now use the new materials with your render pipeline.

Note: These instructions assume that you have already imported the original asset into your Unity project and that the patch unitypackage is compatible with the version of the asset you are using.

Tested with HDRP 10.10.10 on Unity 2020.3.4f1
